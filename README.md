# Easy README Creator ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
  
## Description
I created this project to give programmers an application that will use the precoded template and their responses to create a new README. This provides students with a completed and well structured README that'll contain all necessary information regarding the purpose of the project and how to use it. In addition, users will no longer have to search the documentation  of how to write a README file again.

## Usage 
After following the steps for installation, to begin using the application, type node intall.js in the terminal and answer all the questions that appear.
